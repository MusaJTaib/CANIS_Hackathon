What it does:
Our data visualization tools provide a comprehensive overview of news articles, enabling users to quickly identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in large data sets.

How we built it:
We used Spacy, Python NLTK, TextBlob, pandas, etc to preprocess data and perform text analysis. We used matplotlib and D3 JS to our visualization, and our web app is built on top of express js and node js

Challenges we ran into:
It was difficult to use D3 JS as most of us are used to using Python frameworks to visualize data, many of us had to watch tutorials and read many documentation, but we were able to overcome this challenge by persevering through it and never giving up :)

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud that we built a fully functioning web application for our data visualization tool, and we used a lot of data analysis natural language processing techniques with NLTK and Spacy

What we learned:
We learned how to use D3 JS library, it was the most difficult but we are glad that we overcame the initial steep learning curve and made something really cool and exciting.

What's next for News Guardian:
We want to add more features, make graphs and charts more interactive, and potentially a detector for fake news and propaganda.
